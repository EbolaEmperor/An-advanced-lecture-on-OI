abstract = {Normal 0 false false false Numerical Analysis, Second Edition, is a modern and readable text. This book covers not only the standard topics but also some more advanced numerical methods being used by computational scientists and engineerstopics such as compression, forward and backward error analysis, and iterative methods of solving equationsall while maintaining a level of discussion appropriate for undergraduates. Each chapter contains a Reality Check, which is an extended exploration of relevant application areas that can launch individual or team projects. MATLAB is used throughout to demonstrate and implement numerical methods. The Second Edition features many noteworthy improvements based on feedback from users, such as new coverage of Cholesky factorization, GMRES methods, and nonlinear PDEs.}
